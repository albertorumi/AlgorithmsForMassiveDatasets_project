# Algorithms for massive datasets, analysis on IMDb dataset

In this project I've developed and analyzed different algorithms we discussed during lecture which aim is to find frequent itemsets from a dataset. This study is applied to the IMDb dataset published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ashirwadsangwan/imdb-dataset) under IMDb non-commercial licensing and describes how the A Priori, PCY, SON and Toivonen algorithms are implemented and how my implementation performs. 



In this repository you can find the [report](https://github.com/albertorumi/AlgorithmsForMassiveDatasets_project/blob/main/Report_project.pdf) of the project and also the [implementation](https://github.com/albertorumi/AlgorithmsForMassiveDatasets_project/blob/main/IMDb_frequent_itemsets.ipynb) I've maid in colab with a corresponding link to it.

To run the project you will need to run the first cell, this will ask you to upload your `kaggle.json` in order to download the dataset. Then the project is composed by an algorithm section and a result section. In the result section there are all the experiments I've maid in order to write the report; maybe run just a few of them or use the agorithm after compiling.
